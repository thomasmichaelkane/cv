### [1] Experience  

#### Scientific Consultant, MeiraGTx, Mar 2019 – present (alongside role as Research Scientist)

After working on the development of two novel functional tests to assess ocular function for use in clinical trials, I have continued to work as a consultant with the pharmaceutical company looking to employ these tests. We have worked under significant time pressure towards getting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for these tests, and one is now the primary endpoint in a worldwide phase 3 gene therapy clinical trial. My key role is leading training sessions of teams of health professionals in other hospitals to perform this new assessment at sites around the world. I am using my experience to prepare others to perform the test to the standard that is required for high quality scientific measurements of any improvement in vision that results from this trial. I have gained invaluable experience teaching, and working with people from different countries and cultures.

#### Senior Research Scientist, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology/Moorfields Eye Hospital, Apr 2017 – Oct 2022

I worked for over five years as a research scientist at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, and carrying out a large proportion of my role in the world leading Moorfields Eye Hospital. The team, headed by Prof. Michel Michaelides and Prof. James Bainbridge, was running clinical trials for novel gene therapy treatments for people with rare inherited retinal diseases. These diseases are the most common form of blindness in the working age population. My work within this team spanned an array of disciplines. I saw research patients on a daily basis, and performed a variety of ophthalmological tests with them, including Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT), visual field testing, colour vision tests to name just a few. A large proportion of the patients were young, and through working with them I have developed excellent skills working with children of all ages in a challenging setting; some of the tests with infants between 0-4 years of age. I had a leading role in the development of two new functional assessments for ocular clinical trials, which has led to my further work with MeiraGTx and other hospital sites. My core area of expertise however, was knowing every aspect of our Adaptive Optics Scanning Light Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). It is a state of the art ophthalmoscope that allows in vivo imaging of cells in the retina. I operated, maintained, and calibrated the device, processed and analysed the images, and also developed new software to help us better interpret this novel data. In 2021 the team built an entirely new AOSLO from scratch with Prof. Alf Dubra, professor of optics at Stanford, the designer of the system. Whilst working with the vast amount of data collected, I became very proficient in Python and Matlab, especially in a scientific context. I was a named author in 19 publications produced by the lab, have a first authorship in Ophthalmic Genetics, and presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting 2019.

#### Personal Assistant/Disability Advocate, London, Nov 2013 – Aug 2020

I worked as a part time personal assistant, whilst at university and for years since, for an individual with cerebral palsy, helping him to live day to day life like anyone else and participating in his campaigning for disability rights. This experience has shown me the obstacles an individual with a disability can face and the ways to overcome them as a team of two, these challenges being anything from simply navigating travel across London, to giving interviews and speaking at international conferences. This has taught me the real importance of organisation, punctuality and reliability, in a position of real responsibility for another person’s wellbeing. In my time working in this role, We attended the UN General Assembly 2016 and World Humanitarian Summit 2015 as delegates campaigning for the inclusion of persons with disabilities in humanitarian action. In my time working with him, I was very fortunate to see this individual receive many awards including an OBE.
