Software Developer with a background of eight years of experience working in Science. I am adept in programming Python and Rust applications in scientific contexts, and I also have recent experience in full-stack development with Django and React. I have thrived in interdisciplinary teams, bridging the gap between research and software engineering. I am passionate about developing high-quality, scalable software solutions that advance scientific discovery, improve healthcare outcomes, or have a positive societal impact.
