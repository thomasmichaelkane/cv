### [1] Experience

#### Software Developer/Scientific Consultant, Self employed, Sep 2022 – present

UCL Institute of Ophthalmology - I am working on various projects in vision science with fellows at my previous full time workplace the UCL IoO. My role primarily consists of developing software to support the team in their research projects into vision science and gene therapy, whilst also inputting to the strategy of the projects. I am in discussion advising them on the feasibility of their research aims, and then designing, programming, and implementing the software to achieve these outcomes. I have developed multiple pieces of software that are currently in use on my own. I mostly work in Python, using specialist libraries such as OpenCV, DeepLabCut, PIL, Shapely, PsychoPy, as well as the more standard maths and data science ones. I also have some experience in Rust.

See my Github for more information on these projects - https://github.com/thomasmichaelkane

MeiraGTx - The development of novel functional tests to assess ocular function for use in clinical trials, now used in a worldwide phase 3 gene therapy clinical trial, and subsequent to this, utilised as a consultant by the pharmaceutical company looking to employ these tests. My main role as a consultant is leading team training sessions for health professionals in hospitals to perform this new assessment at sites around the world. I am using my experience with this test to best prepare others to perform the test to the standard required for high quality scientific measurements of any improvement in vision that results from this trial. I have gained invaluable experience teaching, and working with people from different countries and cultures.

#### Senior Research Scientist, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology/Moorfields Eye Hospital, Apr 2017 – Oct 2022

I worked for over five years as a research scientist at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, and carrying out a large proportion of my role in the world leading Moorfields Eye Hospital. Our team, headed by Prof. Michel Michaelides and Prof. James Bainbridge, was running clinical trials for novel gene therapy treatments for people with rare inherited retinal diseases. These diseases are the most common form of blindness in the working age population. My work within this team spanned an array of disciplines. I saw research patients on a daily basis, and performed a variety of ophthalmological tests with them, including Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT), visual field testing, colour vision tests to name just a few. A large proportion of the patients I saw were children which has helped me develop excellent skills working with kids of all ages in a challenging setting; we have even performed some of the tests on infants between 0-4 years of age. I had a leading role in the development of two new functional assessments for ocular clinical trials, which has led to my further work with MeiraGTx and other hospital sites. My main area of expertise however, was knowing every aspect of our Adaptive Optics Scanning Light Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). It is a state of the art ophthalmoscope that allows in vivo imaging of cells in the retina. I operated, maintained, and calibrated the device, processed and analysed the images, and also developed new software to help us better interpret this novel data. In 2021 we built an entirely new AOSLO from scratch with Prof. Alf Dubra, professor of optics at Stanford, the designer of the system. Whilst working with the vast amount of data that we collect, I became very proficient in Python and Matlab, especially in a scientific context. I also was a named author in 19 publications produced by our lab, have a first authorship in Ophthalmic Genetics, and presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting 2019.

*Titled Senior Research Scientist from October 2019*

#### Personal Assistant/Disability Advocate, London, Nov 2013 – Aug 2020

I worked as a part time personal assistant, whilst at university and since, for a young person with cerebral palsy, helping him in his day to day life; this gave me an excellent insight into the daily obstacles an individual with a disability faces.  I participated closely in his campaign for disability rights, supporting him in giving interviews/speaking at international conferences,  including the UN General Assembly 2016 and World Humanitarian Summit 2015, campaigning for the inclusion of persons with disabilities in humanitarian action. I also supported him in other projects in Istanbul, New York, and Rwanda promoting the rights of children with disabilities around the world.

### [6] Volunteering

Following my role with disability advocacy, I decided to undertake some volunteering opportunities. In recent years I have been fortunate to have the following experiences.

-	***Ukraine (Mar-May 2022)*** – **Paracrew Norway** – Planning and logistics for delivering medicine and food inside Ukraine, and assistance at the border crossing with refugees, including providing shelter and blankets, and anti-trafficking duties.
-	***Ukraine Medyka Border (Mar-May 2022)***  – **World Central Kitchen** – Handing out food night and day at the busiest refugee border crossing out of Ukraine.
-	***London (Mar-Jun 2020)*** – **Local community** – Food deliveries for people shielding in the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic.
