## Employment
### Scientific Consultant, Self-employed (Janssen Pharmaceuticals), Oct 2024 – Present
- Developed novel tests to assess ocular function used in a worldwide phase 3 gene therapy clinical trial.
- I am teaching teams of health professionals to perform this new assessment internationally to ensure excellent scientific standards for the outcome of the trial.

### Scientific Software Developer, Self-employed (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology), Sep 2022 – Sep 2024
- Developed software tools, predominantly in Python, for scientists to use in data collection, processing, and analysis.
- Assisted with scientific strategy for a multitude of research projects in vision science and gene therapy.
- In charge of the entire development pipeline. Some libraries commonly used were OpenCV, CellPose, and DeepLabCut, and some use of Rust and Arduino language.

### Senior Research Scientist, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology/Moorfields Eye Hospital, Apr 2017 – Oct 2022
